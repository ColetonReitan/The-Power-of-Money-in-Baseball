In order to understand the importance of payroll distribution amongst MLB teams and how that affects a team's ability to win, I've decided to create a visual analysis within Tableau. This analysis visualizes a variety of aspects within an MLB payroll and provides insights that creates an understanding of just why a team does well or poorly in a given season. Data has been taken for the 2015 through 2023 seasons. The teams selected to be used in this analysis was based on the number of wins they had in a season as well as how far into the playoffs a team made it - for each year, the 4 worst performing regular season teams, the teams that made it to the Chamiponship series (top 4 playoff teams), and (if not already applied) the teams with the highest and lowest payroll were chosen, using a maximum of 10 teams and a minimum of 8 teams for each season. A more in depth description of the project can be found within the process book. 

A Data Visualization in Business Analytics Individual Final Project, conducted in December 2023. 

Completed using R and Tableu. 

I am continuing to work on this project to include all team data from the 2015 through 2023 seasons, with updates to the data coming soon. Webscraping methods through R software is currently being conducted.
